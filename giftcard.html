    <h1>Messages From Jimmy</h1>
    <p>Hi Erica,</p>

    <p>I hope the candle and this message find you well.</p>
    
    <p>It's spring nights around again.</p>
    
    <p>We only got to spend that fall together. Though it was short, the memories remain unforgettable.</p>
    
    <p>I hope in this spring, the scent of the candle can cheer with you at every moment you shine, and comfort you when times all you want is to recline.</p> 
    
    <p>I will always be happy for you and proud of you. Though I said you are a villain, I meant a villain-like angel, who has an important place in my heart.</p>
    <br />
    <p>In the following summer, we both have new chapters in life to fight for and to savor.</p>
    <p>I will work extremely hard for my life, with a 20-hour flight across from you.</p>
    <p>But I guess what I am saying is, I am and will be always ready for you. Whenever there is a call, I will go wherever you are, to 
       have you rely on me, cry on me or even have a mood-lightening chat, whatever that makes you slightly happier.  
    </p>
    <p>I cannot express enough how much happy I am to reconnect with you. From the dinner we had and the group lunch, I saw you
       have become so confident and pretty. You were shining and glowing from inside out.</p>
    <p>If I was drawn to you back then when we first met, I will be lying to say I am not falling
       for you now. But I can promise you, I want you to be happy, so I will respect you in the way you want me to.  
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Take care Erica, be happy and loved.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sincerely, who holds you dearly</p>
    <p>Jimmy</p>
